THIS IS A SMART CONTRACT THAT CAN ENABLE AN EMPLOYER TO SET THE TIME FOR PAYMENT FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES
IT WORKS THIS WAY 
THE EMPLOYER SETS A COOLDOWN, THE COOLDOWN IS THE TIME IN WHICH THE CONTRACT WILL BE ACCEPTING PAYMENTS
BEFORE THE EMPLOYER CAN SEND ETHER AS PAYMENT THE EMPLOYER(OWNER) HAS TO ADD WORKERS(EMPLOYEES) THE ETHER SENT WILL 
BE SPLIT AMONGST THE EMPLOYEES EQUALLY 
 *NOTE* 
 ONLY THE EMPLOYER(OWNER) CAN ADD AND REMOVE EMPLOYEES 
 
 FOR MORE INFO ABOUT THE CONTRACT 
 COMMENTS HAVE BEEN ADDED AND SOME VARIABLES AND FUNCTIONS ARE SELF EXPLANATORY
 I USED SEND INSTEAD OF TRANSFER BECAUSE IF THERE IS A BAD ACTOR IN THE EMPLOYEES THE BAD ACTOR
 CAN HOLD UP THE ENTIRE TRANSACTION MAKING THE ENTIRE PAYSALARIES FUNCTION TO REVERT
 I USED .send() BECAUSE THE BAD ACTOR WILL BE SKIPPED CAUSING THE TRANSACTION TO NOT REVERT
 ALSO .send() IS MORE PREFERABLE IF THE NUMBER OF RECIPIENTS IS UNKNOWN

 .callValue() IS JUST A RECIPIE FOR DISASTER
 
 .transfer() WOULD HAVE BEEN PREFERRED BUT THERE IS A POSSIBILITY SOMEONE MIGHT HOLD UP THE TRANSACTION
